<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Johann Sebastian Bot is a genetic algorithm created by Dustin Roan, Jeremy Schmich, and Alex Hoopes as a project for their Artificial Intelligence course (CS480).

The idea was to generate a number of random pieces of music split into different "populations", objectively measure each piece of music's quality, and then mix the best members of each population to form new pieces of music. Add in some more randomly generated pieces of music and perform this same process over several thousands of generations, and voila! You will have some small pieces of music that sound pretty decent. :)

Feel free to download and play any of the `Sample.mid` files to see Johann's work in action!

### Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

This was built purely in Python - we used a couple small packages in order to play the music and generate MIDI files, but that's all that was used.

### How To Run

- Docker

  1. `docker compose build`
  2. `docker compose up`
  3. Run will show up in ./currentRun directory

- Python
  1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  2. `python bot.py`
  3. Run will show up in ./currentRun directory

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

It has been a while since we've worked on this project, and honestly if we were to work on it again we might just start from scratch and build a Johann v2.0.

That being said, our general ideas for continuing would be to make the music more complex, include other instruments aside from the single MIDI piano, and maybe even develop some kind of website to host the music that Johann Sebastian Bot would create!

See the [open issues](https://github.com/ShowMeTheRoapes/JohannSebastianBot/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
